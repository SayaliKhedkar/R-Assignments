- Assignment 3 -Naive Bayes is a Supervised Non-linear classification algorithm in R Programming. Naive Bayes classifiers are   a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayeâ€™s theorem with strong(Naive) independence assumptions     between the features or variables.
- Assignment 4 - A column is a vertical representation of data, while a row is a horizontal representation of data.A matrix     can be created with the matrix() function.     Specify the nrow and ncol parameters to get the amount of rows and columns.
